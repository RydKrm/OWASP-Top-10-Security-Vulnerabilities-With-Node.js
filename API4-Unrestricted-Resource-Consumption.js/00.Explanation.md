### What is it??

Unrestricted Resource Consumption, also known as Denial of Service (DoS) in OWASP, refers to a situation where an attacker can exploit a system by consuming its resources excessively without any limitation, causing the system to slow down or crash. Resources like CPU, memory, disk space, network bandwidth, or database connections can be targeted, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.

### Key Points:

##### No Limits on Requests:

If the system does not restrict the number of requests a user can make, attackers can flood the system with requests, overwhelming the available resources.

##### Large Payloads:

Attackers can send excessively large payloads or files, consuming memory or storage.

##### CPU-Intensive Operations:

Complex calculations or expensive database queries without restrictions can lead to high CPU utilization.

##### Massive Data Uploads/Downloads:

A system without upload/download limits allows attackers to consume bandwidth, making the service unavailable to others.

##### Example Scenario:

Imagine an API that allows users to upload files without any restrictions. An attacker can upload large files continuously, consuming disk space and potentially crashing the server.

### How to Mitigate:

##### Rate Limiting:

Restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a specific time period.

##### Size Limits:

Impose limits on the size of uploaded files or the amount of data processed per request.

##### Timeouts:

Set timeouts for long-running operations or database queries.

##### Input Validation:

Ensure that user inputs (like files, queries, etc.) are properly validated and restricted.
By addressing unrestricted resource consumption, systems can protect themselves from abuse and ensure service availability for legitimate users.
