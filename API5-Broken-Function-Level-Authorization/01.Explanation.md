### Broken Function Level Authorization

Broken Function Level Authorization is an OWASP vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly enforce user roles and permissions for specific actions (functions). This can allow an attacker to execute functionality they are not authorized to access, such as modifying, deleting, or retrieving sensitive data.

##### Key Characteristics:

- Lack of Role Validation: If an API or application does not verify whether the user has the correct permissions to perform an action.
- Exposing Critical Actions: Exposing sensitive or administrative functions to users who shouldn’t have access.
- Insecure Endpoints: Endpoints that are accessible by users without verifying whether they have the appropriate access rights.

##### Example Scenario :

In an e-commerce application, there are different roles like admin and customer. Admins can delete any user’s account, but customers should only be able to delete
their own account. If an API endpoint `/deleteUser/:userId` doesn't check the user's role or ownership of the account, a customer might exploit this and delete other users' accounts.
