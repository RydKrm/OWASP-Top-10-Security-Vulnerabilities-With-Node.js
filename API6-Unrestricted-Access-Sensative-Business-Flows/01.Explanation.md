### API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

when an API exposes sensitive business processes without enforcing proper access control. This allows unauthorized users to execute critical business functions, leading to significant security risks, financial losses, or operational issues.

##### Key Characteristics:

- Lack of Authorization: APIs do not verify if a user has permission to perform specific business actions.
- Sensitive Operations: These are operations that can have severe consequences if accessed improperly, like financial transactions, modifying account settings, or - managing user data.
- Business Logic Exposure: Without restrictions, attackers can exploit APIs to manipulate business processes.

#### Example Scenario

An online banking API allows users to initiate money transfers. If the API doesn’t enforce proper access controls, an attacker or regular user might transfer funds from any account, bypassing ownership or authorization checks. This could lead to unauthorized transactions or manipulation of sensitive financial flows.

A seller should only be allowed to refund their own customers’ orders. However, due to missing access control, they can refund any order, even those processed by other sellers, leading to financial losses for the platform.

#### Mitigation Strategies:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement strict checks to ensure users have the necessary permissions to perform sensitive business operations.
- Business Logic Validation: Ensure that APIs enforce proper ownership and access rules before allowing actions like transfers, refunds, or critical updates.
- Rate Limiting: Protect sensitive business flows by limiting how often critical actions can be performed.
