### Unsafe Consumption of APIs

It refers to vulnerabilities that arise when an application interacts with external APIs in an insecure manner. This can expose the application and its users to various risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party services.

##### Key Points of Unsafe Consumption of APIs

- Lack of Input Validation:
  Applications often fail to validate or sanitize input received from APIs. This can lead to injection attacks, where an attacker can exploit the application by sending malicious input.
- Insecure Authentication:
  If an application does not use secure authentication methods (like OAuth), it may allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data or functionalities through the API.
- Excessive Permissions:
  APIs might be exposed with overly broad permissions, allowing users to perform actions that should be restricted, such as modifying data they donâ€™t own.
- Insecure Data Transmission:
  If API calls are made over unencrypted channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS), sensitive data can be intercepted by attackers during transmission.
- Exposure to Third-Party Vulnerabilities:
  Consuming APIs from third-party services can introduce risks if those services have their own vulnerabilities. An attack on a third-party API can have cascading effects on applications that rely on it.
- Improper Error Handling:
  Applications may expose sensitive information in error messages returned by APIs, which can be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the system.
